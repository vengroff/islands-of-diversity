# islands-of-diversity
Data analysis for islands of diversity work.

This project contains the code behind 
[I Want to Visit Ligonier, Indiana](https://datapinions.com/i-want-to-visit-ligonier-indiana/),
an essay examining the nature of what I call *islands of diversity* in the United States.

The code is in the form of two Python notebooks, in the `notebooks` directory of this project.
